## 📊 Engagement Tactics Working

### Message Framework
1. **Validate their insight** ("This is exactly...")
2. **Share real data** (44% hallucination, 73% pass rate)
3. **Connect to problem** (measurement, quality, execution)
4. **Present solution** (EmbedEval naturally)
5. **Strong CTAs:**
   - ⭐ GitHub star for believers
   - ☕ Coffee for supporters
   - GitHub link always included

### Key Stats Shared
- 73% pass rate (100 traces evaluated)
- 44% failures = hallucination (sounding smart, no substance)
- 30% failures = incomplete (starting, not shipping)
- 20 files (down from 88 in v1)

### Core Philosophy Pushed
**"Self-evaluation is not optional - it's how agents become assets instead of just tools"**
