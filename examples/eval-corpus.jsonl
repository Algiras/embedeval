{"id": "doc1", "content": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The primary types include supervised learning, where models learn from labeled data, unsupervised learning for finding patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning where agents learn through trial and error.", "metadata": {"category": "ai", "topic": "machine_learning"}}
{"id": "doc2", "content": "Deep learning is part of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. Neural networks require careful optimization of hyperparameters, learning rates, and regularization techniques for effective training.", "metadata": {"category": "ai", "topic": "deep_learning"}}
{"id": "doc3", "content": "Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally occurring lactobacilli and yeast. The process requires a sourdough starter, which is a fermented mixture of flour and water containing wild yeast and bacteria. Creating and maintaining a starter involves regular feedings with fresh flour and water, typically in a 1:1:1 ratio. The fermentation process takes longer than commercial yeast bread but produces a distinctive tangy flavor and better digestibility.", "metadata": {"category": "cooking", "topic": "bread"}}
{"id": "doc4", "content": "To bake sourdough bread, you need flour, water, salt, and a sourdough starter. The process involves mixing, folding, bulk fermentation for 4-8 hours, shaping, proofing overnight in the refrigerator, and baking at 450-500°F (230-260°C). Temperature and timing are crucial for developing flavor and texture. The bread should be baked in a Dutch oven or with steam for the best crust. Internal temperature should reach 205-210°F when done.", "metadata": {"category": "cooking", "topic": "bread"}}
{"id": "doc5", "content": "REST API design best practices include using proper HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for full updates, PATCH for partial updates, DELETE for removal), implementing pagination for large datasets, using JSON for data exchange, versioning your API through URL path or headers, and providing clear error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes. Authentication can be handled via API keys, OAuth, or JWT tokens.", "metadata": {"category": "programming", "topic": "api"}}
{"id": "doc6", "content": "When designing REST APIs, follow resource-oriented architecture. Use nouns for endpoints (e.g., /users not /getUsers), implement filtering and sorting query parameters, use HATEOAS for discoverability, and document your API with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. Version your API early using semantic versioning. Consider rate limiting, caching strategies with ETags, and proper CORS configuration for web clients.", "metadata": {"category": "programming", "topic": "api"}}
{"id": "doc7", "content": "TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, adding optional static type definitions which help catch errors during development rather than runtime. TypeScript code compiles to plain JavaScript and runs anywhere JavaScript runs - browsers, Node.js, Deno, and more. The type system supports interfaces, generics, union types, and type inference, making code more maintainable and self-documenting.", "metadata": {"category": "programming", "topic": "typescript"}}

{"id": "doc9", "content": "Word embeddings are dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning of words. Techniques like Word2Vec use neural networks to learn embeddings from large text corpora, where words appearing in similar contexts get similar vectors. GloVe combines global matrix factorization with local context windows.

{"id": "doc10", "content": "The transformer architecture revolutionized NLP through its self-attention mechanism, which allows models to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when producing outputs. Unlike RNNs, transformers process all positions in parallel, enabling much faster training on large datasets. Key components include multi-head attention, positional encodings, layer normalization, and feed-forward networks. Models like GPT and BERT are built on transformer architectures.", "metadata": {"category": "ai", "topic": "transformers"}}
