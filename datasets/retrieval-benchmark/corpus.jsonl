{"id":"ml-1","content":"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Common approaches include supervised learning with labeled data, unsupervised learning for pattern discovery, and reinforcement learning through trial and error."}
{"id":"ml-2","content":"Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological brains. They consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers that process information. Deep learning uses networks with many hidden layers to learn hierarchical representations."}
{"id":"ml-3","content":"Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts parameters by computing gradients and moving in the direction of steepest descent."}
{"id":"ml-4","content":"Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise in training data rather than general patterns. Regularization techniques like L1, L2, dropout, and early stopping help prevent overfitting by constraining model complexity."}
{"id":"ml-5","content":"Transfer learning allows models trained on one task to be adapted for related tasks. Pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and ResNet provide starting points that can be fine-tuned on smaller domain-specific datasets."}
{"id":"nlp-1","content":"Word embeddings represent words as dense vectors capturing semantic meaning. Word2Vec learns embeddings by predicting context words, while GloVe combines global matrix factorization with local context windows."}
{"id":"nlp-2","content":"Transformers revolutionized NLP through self-attention mechanisms that weigh importance of different input parts. Unlike RNNs, transformers process sequences in parallel, enabling faster training on large datasets."}
{"id":"nlp-3","content":"BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) uses masked language modeling to create contextualized embeddings. It reads text bidirectionally to understand context from both directions."}
{"id":"nlp-4","content":"Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies and classifies named entities like persons, organizations, and locations in text. Modern NER systems use sequence labeling with BiLSTM-CRF or transformer architectures."}
{"id":"nlp-5","content":"Sentiment analysis determines emotional tone in text, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. Approaches range from lexicon-based methods to deep learning classifiers trained on labeled reviews."}
{"id":"db-1","content":"SQL databases use structured query language for relational data. Tables with rows and columns store data with relationships defined through foreign keys. ACID properties ensure transaction reliability."}
{"id":"db-2","content":"NoSQL databases handle unstructured data with flexible schemas. Document stores like MongoDB, key-value stores like Redis, and graph databases like Neo4j serve different use cases than traditional SQL."}
{"id":"db-3","content":"Database indexing speeds up queries by creating data structures for faster lookups. B-trees are common for range queries, while hash indexes excel at exact matches. Index selection involves query pattern analysis."}
{"id":"db-4","content":"Vector databases specialize in storing and querying high-dimensional embeddings. They use approximate nearest neighbor algorithms like HNSW and IVF for efficient similarity search at scale."}
{"id":"db-5","content":"Database sharding partitions data across multiple servers to handle scale. Horizontal sharding distributes rows while vertical sharding splits columns. Consistent hashing helps route queries to correct shards."}
{"id":"web-1","content":"REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for resource operations. Stateless design, resource-based URLs, and JSON responses are key principles. Proper status codes indicate success or failure."}
{"id":"web-2","content":"GraphQL provides a query language for APIs allowing clients to request specific data. Unlike REST, a single endpoint handles queries, mutations, and subscriptions with a strongly typed schema."}
{"id":"web-3","content":"React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces using components. Virtual DOM efficiently updates only changed elements. Hooks like useState and useEffect manage state and side effects."}
{"id":"web-4","content":"CSS Grid and Flexbox are layout systems for responsive web design. Grid handles two-dimensional layouts while Flexbox excels at one-dimensional distribution of items in rows or columns."}
{"id":"web-5","content":"Web security involves protecting against attacks like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection. HTTPS encrypts traffic, CORS controls resource sharing, and content security policies restrict script execution."}
{"id":"devops-1","content":"Docker containers package applications with dependencies for consistent deployment. Images are built from Dockerfiles, and containers share the host OS kernel unlike virtual machines."}
{"id":"devops-2","content":"Kubernetes orchestrates container deployment across clusters. Pods group containers, services provide networking, and deployments manage replicas. YAML manifests declare desired state."}
{"id":"devops-3","content":"CI/CD pipelines automate building, testing, and deploying code changes. Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI run workflows triggered by commits or pull requests."}
{"id":"devops-4","content":"Infrastructure as Code (IaC) manages cloud resources through configuration files. Terraform uses declarative HCL, while Pulumi allows programming languages. Version control tracks infrastructure changes."}
{"id":"devops-5","content":"Monitoring and observability track system health through metrics, logs, and traces. Prometheus collects metrics, ELK stack handles logs, and Jaeger provides distributed tracing."}
{"id":"cook-1","content":"Sourdough bread requires a fermented starter made from flour and water. Wild yeast and bacteria create the distinctive tangy flavor. Bulk fermentation takes 4-8 hours at room temperature."}
{"id":"cook-2","content":"Italian risotto is made by gradually adding warm broth to arborio rice while stirring. The starch release creates a creamy texture. Finish with butter and parmesan cheese."}
{"id":"sports-1","content":"Basketball requires dribbling, passing, and shooting skills. Five players per team compete to score through the hoop. The NBA season runs from October to June."}
{"id":"history-1","content":"The Renaissance was a cultural movement beginning in 14th century Italy. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo created masterpieces. Humanism emphasized individual potential."}
